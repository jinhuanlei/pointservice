## Environment Setup

We can run the program by either Java Virtual Machine or Docker. Docker solution should be cleanest
and easiest way for running this program.

### Run the service by JVM

1. install java 17

Option 1: install java by homebrew

```
brew tap bell-sw/liberica
brew install --cask liberica-jdk17
```

Option 2: install official java package
